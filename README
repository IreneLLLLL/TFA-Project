Our selection of zipcode: 10027 which is around Columbia University.

There are two files included:

2. Parking.ipynb
    This file shows our analysis of whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents around Columbia University than they are in general.

    Our result shows that the illegal parking incidents rate around Columbia University(zip code 10027) is about 0.05, but the illegal parking incidents rate across all zip codes is about 0.07.
